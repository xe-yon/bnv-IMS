# bnv-IMS
An all-in-one Inventory Management System made with C#.NET in Visual Studio. The application has advanced charting, stock control, report generation, and a powerful POS feature, it streamlines inventory operations for seamless management.


Note: I have used Bunifu and Guna Framework when I developed this system so you might need to install those if you are going to make some modifications.
